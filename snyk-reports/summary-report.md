## Key Findings

1. The basic NGINX deployment (nginx:1.14.2) has a large number of vulnerabilities, including 28 critical issues.
2. Switching to the Alpine-based image (nginx:1.28.0-alpine) significantly reduced the number of vulnerabilities.
3. Implementing security best practices in the Kubernetes manifest reduced the number of IaC issues.
4. The fully secure deployment addresses all identified security concerns.

## Recommendations

1. Always use the latest Alpine-based images for minimal attack surface.
2. Implement security context settings in Kubernetes manifests:
   - Set `runAsNonRoot: true`
   - Set `runAsUser: 10000` (or higher)
   - Set `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
   - Set `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
   - Drop all capabilities with `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`
3. Set resource limits for all containers.
4. Configure liveness probes for better health monitoring.
5. Set `imagePullPolicy: Always` to ensure the latest image is used.
6. Mount required directories as volumes when using read-only root filesystem.

## Conclusion

By following security best practices and using secure base images, we can significantly reduce the security risks in our Kubernetes deployments.
