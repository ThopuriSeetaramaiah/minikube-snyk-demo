# Snyk Security Reports

This directory contains the security scan reports generated by Snyk for our Kubernetes deployments and container images.

## Report Files

- `nginx-basic-iac-report.json`: Infrastructure as Code scan results for the basic NGINX deployment
- `nginx-basic-container-report.json`: Container scan results for nginx:1.14.2
- `nginx-secure-iac-report.json`: Infrastructure as Code scan results for the secure NGINX deployment
- `nginx-secure-container-report.json`: Container scan results for nginx:1.28.0-alpine
- `fully-secure-nginx-report.json`: Infrastructure as Code scan results for the fully secure NGINX deployment
- `summary-report.md`: Summary of all scan results

## Key Findings

The basic NGINX deployment using nginx:1.14.2 has a total of 252 container vulnerabilities, including 28 critical issues. By switching to nginx:1.28.0-alpine and implementing security best practices in the Kubernetes manifest, we were able to significantly reduce the number of vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Reduction

| Deployment | Container Vulnerabilities | IaC Issues |
|------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Basic NGINX | 252 (28 critical, 47 high, 52 medium, 125 low) | 9 (0 critical, 0 high, 3 medium, 6 low) |
| Secure NGINX | 2 (0 critical, 2 high, 0 medium, 0 low) | 5 (0 critical, 0 high, 3 medium, 2 low) |
| Fully Secure NGINX | 2 (0 critical, 2 high, 0 medium, 0 low) | 0 (0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium, 0 low) |

## Recommendations

1. Always use the latest Alpine-based images for minimal attack surface
2. Implement security context settings in Kubernetes manifests
3. Set resource limits for all containers
4. Configure liveness probes for better health monitoring
5. Set `imagePullPolicy: Always` to ensure the latest image is used
